### 2026-03-23 — Enhanced Agent Infrastructure
- **Created** `.agents/workflows/` with standardized workflows for `feature-work` and `documentation-sync`.
- **Updated** `AGENT_INFO.md` with guidelines on using internal agent artifacts (`task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, `walkthrough.md`).
- **Refined** agent rules in `PROJECT.md` to formalize the use of workflows and internal artifacts.

### 2026-03-23 — History Page Scroll Fix
- **Fixed** touch event interception logic in `HistoryBarChartView` and `HistoryTimelineView` to only trigger on horizontal dragging, allowing seamless vertical scrolling of the history page.

- **Improved** hit detection accuracy in `SessionTracker`.
- **Added** estimated time to start based on target temperature and historical heat-up times.
- **Updated** Session UI for a more premium aesthetic.
- **Modified** `AnalyticsRepository`, `MainViewModel`, and `DeviceStatus` to support the new session logic.

### 2026-03-23 — UI Decomposition (MainActivity)
- **Extracted** `LandingFragment`, `SessionFragment`, `HistoryFragment`, `BatteryFragment`, and `SettingsFragment` from `MainActivity.kt` to their own files (`com/sbtracker/ui/`).
- **Extracted** `relativeDate` and `formatDurationShort` functions to `com/sbtracker/util/FormatUtils.kt`.
- `MainActivity.kt` reduced from 1169 lines to minimal boilerplate.
