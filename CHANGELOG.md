### 2026-03-23 17:30 — History Page Scroll Fix (Antigravity)
- **Fixed** touch event interception logic in `HistoryBarChartView` and `HistoryTimelineView` to only trigger on horizontal dragging, allowing seamless vertical scrolling of the history page.

- **Improved** hit detection accuracy in `SessionTracker`.
- **Added** estimated time to start based on target temperature and historical heat-up times.
- **Updated** Session UI for a more premium aesthetic.
- **Modified** `AnalyticsRepository`, `MainViewModel`, and `DeviceStatus` to support the new session logic.

### 2026-03-23 16:58 — UI Decomposition (Antigravity)
- **Extracted** `LandingFragment`, `SessionFragment`, `HistoryFragment`, `BatteryFragment`, and `SettingsFragment` from `MainActivity.kt` to their own files (`com/sbtracker/ui/`).
- **Extracted** `relativeDate` and `formatDurationShort` functions to `com/sbtracker/util/FormatUtils.kt`.
