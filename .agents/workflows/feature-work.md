## ⚠️ BRANCHING RULES — READ BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

```
main   ← NEVER touch directly. Stable releases only.
dev    ← NEVER push feature code here directly. PRs only.
  └── claude/T-XXX-...  ← your branch. always branched FROM dev.
```

- **Every feature/fix lives on its own `claude/T-XXX-*` branch.**
- **Every branch is submitted as a PR targeting `dev`.** Never `main`.
- **The ONLY thing you may push directly to `dev`** is the meta-file status update in Step 7 (marking the task `done` in `.agents/TASKS.md`). Nothing else.
- If you are unsure whether something is a meta-file, **it is not — use a PR.**

## Steps

1. Pick a `ready` task from `.agents/TASKS.md` and read its task file.

2. **Create your branch from dev:**
   ```
   git fetch origin dev
   git checkout -b claude/T-XXX-description origin/dev
   ```

3. Follow the steps in the task file exactly.
   - Read only the files listed under "Read these files first".
   - Change only the files listed under "Change only these files".

4. Run `./gradlew assembleDebug` — **must pass** before committing. Fix any compile errors; do not skip.

5. Commit your work:
   ```
   git add <changed files>
   git commit -m "T-XXX: description of change"
   ```
   Do **not** add unrelated files. Do **not** add TASKS.md here — that comes later.

6. Append one line to `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`, commit it on your branch.

7. **Rebase onto latest `dev` before pushing** to ensure a clean, conflict-free PR:
   ```
   git fetch origin dev
   git rebase origin/dev
   ```
   Resolve any conflicts, then `git rebase --continue`.

8. Push your branch and open a PR targeting **`dev`** (not main):
   ```
   git push -u origin claude/T-XXX-description
   ```
   Then create the PR using the `mcp__github__create_pull_request` tool with:
   - `owner`: `0022111`
   - `repo`: `sbtracker`
   - `title`: `T-XXX — Task Title`
   - `body`: summary of changes + `Closes T-XXX`
   - `head`: `claude/T-XXX-description`
   - `base`: `dev`   ← **always dev, never main**

9. **Mark the task done — direct meta push to `dev`:**
   On your feature branch, update `.agents/TASKS.md` status to `done`, then push just that commit to dev:
   ```
   git add .agents/TASKS.md
   git commit -m "meta: T-XXX done"
   git fetch origin dev
   git push origin HEAD:dev
   ```
   This is the only direct-to-dev push you are permitted to make.
